# Static Product List Display

This is a simple React application that displays a static list of products. Each product includes a name, description, and price.

## Getting Started

To view the static product list, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/el-riber/web13
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd product-list`
3. Install dependencies by running: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`
5. Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to view the product list.

## Layout and Styling

The product list is displayed using the `ProductList` component, which renders each product as a separate item. Basic styling has been applied to ensure readability and organization.

## Components

- **App.js**: The main component that renders the `ProductList` component.
- **ProductList.js**: The component responsible for rendering the list of products.

## Product Data

Product data is stored directly within the `ProductList` component as an array of objects. Each object represents a product and includes properties such as id, name, description, and price.

## Dependencies

This project uses Create React App for bootstrapping the React application.
